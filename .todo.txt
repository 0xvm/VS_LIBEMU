debug shell additions:
---------------------------
.shapshot - all the underlying structure is already in place except flags save
for jxx   - .jmp to force a jump

if i was really fancy, dbg shell would show in lower half of console, api in top, and registers on right..
but you would loose scroll back ability..

antispam on jmp+5 detection?
give debug shell a real command line parser to avoid all the prompts?
