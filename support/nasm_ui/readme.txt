
this is a quick utility to assemble bits of shellcode using nasm

I use this to test sequences in scdbg and compare the results to
what I see in olly.

assumes paths to my dev machine:

c:\nasm\nasm.exe
D:\_code\libemu\git_libemu\bin\scdbg.exe
D:\_code\libemu\VS_LIBEMU\scdbg.exe
C:\tools\odbg110\OLLYDBG.EXE

if you want to use this, you can replicate these paths or change and recompile.
